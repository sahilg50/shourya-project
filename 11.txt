-- Step 1: Create the Student Table and Insert Data
-- Create the student table
CREATE TABLE student (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    grade FLOAT,
    major VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO student (id, name, age, grade, major) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 20, 85.5, 'Computer Science'),
(2, 'Bob', 22, 90.0, 'Mathematics'),
(3, 'Charlie', 21, 78.2, 'Physics'),
(4, 'David', 23, 92.1, 'Computer Science'),
(5, 'Eve', 20, 88.9, 'Mathematics'),
(6, 'Frank', 24, 76.5, 'Biology'),
(7, 'Grace', 22, 83.2, 'Computer Science'),
(8, 'Hannah', 23, 87.3, 'Mathematics'),
(9, 'Ian', 21, 68.4, 'Physics'),
(10, 'Jack', 20, 92.7, 'Chemistry');


-- Step 2: ALTER Table
-- Add a new attribute (e.g., email column):
ALTER TABLE student
ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);

-- Modify data type of an existing attribute (e.g., change grade to DECIMAL type):
ALTER TABLE student
MODIFY COLUMN grade DECIMAL(5, 2);

-- Drop an attribute (e.g., email column):
ALTER TABLE student
DROP COLUMN email;


-- Step 3: UPDATE Table
-- Update the grade of a student with id 1
UPDATE student
SET grade = 89.5
WHERE id = 1;


-- Step 4: ORDER BY
-- Order by grade in ascending order:
SELECT * FROM student
ORDER BY grade ASC;

-- Order by age in descending order:
SELECT * FROM student
ORDER BY age DESC;


-- Step 5: DELETE
-- Delete a specific student by ID:
DELETE FROM student
WHERE id = 5;

-- Delete all students in the Mathematics major:
DELETE FROM student
WHERE major = 'Mathematics';


-- Step 6: GROUP BY with Aggregate Functions
-- Find the minimum, maximum, sum, count, and average grade for each major
SELECT major,
       MIN(grade) AS min_grade,
       MAX(grade) AS max_grade,
       SUM(grade) AS total_grade,
       COUNT(*) AS student_count,
       AVG(grade) AS average_grade
FROM student
GROUP BY major;
